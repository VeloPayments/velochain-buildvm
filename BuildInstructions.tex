\title{Build Instructions for velochain}

\section{Introduction}

This document covers the build and configuration process for the velochain OS
image. Much of the inspiration for this document and build came from the
\emph{Linux Journal} article,
\jhref{https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/diy-build-custom-minimal-linux-distribution-source}{
``DIY: Build a Custom Minimal Linux Distribution from Source''}, by Petros
Koutoupis.

To fetch all relevant packages and build this OS image, you will need to run
these scripts from a Linux system.  The following commands can be executed:

\begin{lstlisting}
mkdir build
cd build
../extract.sh ../BuildInstructions.tex
./make-build-document.sh
./make-image.sh
\end{lstlisting}

This document builds the following versions of components. These will be updated
in subsequent releases.

<<versions>>=
LINUX_VERSION=5.13.9
GCC_VERSION=11.2.0
GMP_VERSION=6.2.1
MPFR_VERSION=4.1.0
MPC_VERSION=1.2.1
GLIBC_VERSION=2.34
BUSYBOX_VERSION=1.33.1
>>@<<

The rest of this document will describe the build process in detail.

\section{Extracting source files from this document}

We use \verb/mintangle/ to extract the source files from this document.
Everything is provided in the script, \verb/extract.sh/, which is provided both
in this document and in this source distribution.  This script reads a listing
of all script files from this document, extracts them, and marks them as
executable.  Then, it extracts all other files from this document.

To start, we define a variable to stand in for the main document.  This is done
mainly to keep the source listings within the margin of this document.

<<doc>>=
DOC=../BuildInstructions.tex
>>@<<

For the non-scripts, we just extract them.  The \verb/-L/ option for
\verb/mintangle/ lists all \verb/FILE/ sections, which are the various roots for
files.  This is then fed to \verb/egrep/ to \emph{exclude} any file ending in
\verb/.sh/.  The \verb/-r/ option allows for the selection of the root for
extraction.  The \verb/mintangle/ command evaluates all macros within the
document and then applies them to where they are used.  It then extracts the
root (\verb/*/ if one is not specified with \verb/-r/), writing this value to
an output file.

<<extract-non-scripts>>=
for n in `mintangle -L $DOC | egrep -v "[.]sh$|[.]exp$"`; do
    mintangle -r $n $DOC
done
>>@<<

For the scripts, we extract them and mark them as executable. Here, we make use
of \verb/chmod/ to mark them as executable. The \verb/-v/ option is left off of
\verb/egrep/ to \emph{include} only these files instead of excluding them from
the results.

<<extract-scripts>>=
for n in `mintangle -L $DOC | egrep "[.]sh$|[.]exp"$`; do
    mintangle -r $n $DOC && touch $n && chmod +x $n
done
>>@<<

\newpage

The complete shell script can thus be assembled.  Note that the name of this
root is \verb/FILE:extract.sh/, (rendered as just \verb/extract.sh/ in the final
document) which indicates that this is the desired filename for extraction.
Each of the macro references, starting with the double less-than and ending with
the double greater-than, but without the assignment at the end, cause
\verb/mintangle/ to perform a text substitution, placing the value defined above
into the macro at that place.  Besides that, we see the shebang to define this
script as a Bourne shell script, which is the convention used throughout the
rest of the document.  This extraction script is checked in verbatim as a
convenience to bootstrap this build process.

<<FILE:extract.sh>>=
#!/bin/sh

<<doc>>
<<extract-non-scripts>>
<<extract-scripts>>
>>@<<

\section{Building this Document}

To build this document, we use \verb/minweave/ to weave it, all macros, and the
template into a valid PDF file.  The script to do this is here.  The \verb/-L/
option here specifies the markup language as Bourne Shell. The \verb/-T/ option
specifies a template to use to make this document reflect a more typical Velo
Payments look and feel.  Finally, \verb/pdflatex/ is used to transform this
document into a PDF.

<<FILE:make-build-document.sh>>=
#!/bin/sh

minweave -L sh -o BuildInstructions.tex -T ../template.tex \
    ../BuildInstructions.tex
pdflatex BuildInstructions.tex
pdflatex BuildInstructions.tex
>>@<<

\pagebreak

\section{Build Script Basics}

We want this shell script to display every line as it executes (\verb/-x/),
to exit on the first failure (\verb/-e/), and to hash all commands (\verb/-h/).

<<FILE:build.sh>>=
#!/bin/bash -e -x -h
>>@<<

This script uses the versions defined at the beginning of this document.

<<FILE:build.sh>>=
<<versions>>
export LINUX_VERSION GCC_VERSION GMP_VERSION MPFR_VERSION
export MPC_VERSION GLIBC_VERSION BUSYBOX_VERSION
>>@<<

Next, we set the default user mask to \verb/S_IWGRP/ \verb/|/ \verb/S_IWOTH/, or
$022$.  This ensures that only the user has write permissions on the files
created.  While this is the default, it's possible that the current umask under
which this script is executing is not the default.

<<FILE:build.sh>>=
umask 022
>>@<<

For convenience, we save the current working directory as \verb/WD/, which saves
the script from having to compute this directory repeatedly. We then query the
number of processor cores using the \verb/getconf/ command.  Next, \verb/OSDIR/
is set to where the OS image will be built. We then set \verb/LC_ALL/ and
\verb/PATH/ to sane values. We set \verb/PKG_DIR/ to the location where we will
fetch packages.  Finally, we create the \verb/OSDIR/ and \verb/PKG_DIR/
directories.

<<FILE:build.sh>>=
WD=`pwd`
CORES=`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN`
OSDIR=${WD}/linux
LC_ALL=POSIX
PATH=${OSDIR}/cross-tools/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
PKG_DIR=${WD}/packages
export WD CORES OSDIR LC_ALL PATH PKG_DIR
mkdir -pv $OSDIR $PKG_DIR
>>@<<

To round out the basics that we need to set up for this OS build, we will create
the image directory hierarchy, the cross-tools directory, the root entry in our
\verb/passwd/ file, the default \verb/group/ file, the default \verb/fstab/,
the default \verb/.profile/, the host name, the login message, the basic
\verb/busybox/ \verb/inittab/, the default \verb/mdev.conf/, the default
\verb/grub.cfg/, and the starting log files. However, we only want to do this
work once: when these files do not exist. So, at the end of this process, we
will touch a \verb/.basics/ file which indicates that we completed this step.

<<FILE:build.sh>>=
if [ ! -f ${WD}/.basics ]; then
    <<basics-image-directory-hierarchy>>
    <<basics-cross-tools-directory>>
    <<basics-passwd>>
    <<basics-group>>
    <<basics-fstab>>
    <<basics-profile>>
    <<basics-hostname>>
    <<basics-login>>
    <<basics-busybox-inittab>>
    <<basics-mdev-conf>>
    <<basics-grub-cfg>>
    <<basics-log-files>>
    touch ${WD}/.basics
else
    echo "Basics already built."
fi
>>@<<

\subsection{Image Directory Hierarchy}

We can now build up the required directory hierarchy for the image filesystem.
This directory structure is largely defined by the POSIX standard. As long as
these directories exist, most if not all programs we try to run in the image
will operate correctly.

<<basics-image-directory-hierarchy>>=
mkdir -pv $OSDIR
mkdir -pv ${OSDIR}/{bin,boot{,grub},dev,{etc/,}opt,home,lib/{firmware,modules},lib64,mnt}
mkdir -pv ${OSDIR}/{proc,media/{floppy,cdrom},sbin,srv,sys}
mkdir -pv ${OSDIR}/var/{lock,log,mail,run,spool}
mkdir -pv ${OSDIR}/var/{opt,cache,lib/{misc,locate},local}
install -dv -m 0750 ${OSDIR}/root
install -dv -m 1777 ${OSDIR}{/var,}/tmp
install -dv ${OSDIR}/etc/init.d
mkdir -pv ${OSDIR}/usr/{,local/}{bin,include,lib{,64},sbin,src}
mkdir -pv ${OSDIR}/usr/{,local/}share/{doc,info,locale,man}
mkdir -pv ${OSDIR}/usr/{,local/}share/{misc,terminfo,zoneinfo}
mkdir -pv ${OSDIR}/usr/{,local/}share/man/man{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
for dir in ${OSDIR}/usr{,/local}; do
    ln -sv share/{man,doc,info} ${dir}
done
mkdir -pv ${OSDIR}/boot/grub
>>@<<

\subsection{Cross Tools Directory}

The Cross Tools directory is where we will install the cross-compilation tools
which are used to build this image.

<<basics-cross-tools-directory>>=
#create the crosstools directory
install -dv ${OSDIR}/cross-tools{,/bin}
>>@<<

\subsection{Unix passwd file}

Next up, we will create a passwd file.  For the time being, it will just include
the \verb/root/ user with no password set.  We will get back to the password
later.

<<basics-passwd>>=
#create a root entry in /etc/passwd with no password for now.
cat > ${OSDIR}/etc/passwd << "EOF"
root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/ash
EOF
>>@<<

\newpage

\subsection{Default group file}

We will create a default group file with all of the groups required by POSIX and
Linux.

<<basics-group>>=
#create a default /etc/group
cat > ${OSDIR}/etc/group << "EOF"
root:x:0:
bin:x:1:
sys:x:2:
kmem:x:3:
tty:x:4:
daemon:x:6:
disk:x:8:
dialout:x:10:
video:x:12:
utmp:x:13:
usb:x:14:
EOF
>>@<<

\subsection{Filesystem Table}

The filesystem table is used to mount each filesystem.  The first entry is for
the physical disk -- the root filesystem.  Subsequent entries are for special
filesystems defined by the Linux kernel.

<<basics-fstab>>=
#the default fstab
cat > ${OSDIR}/etc/fstab << "EOF"
# file system  mount-point  type   options          dump  fsck
#                                                         order

rootfs          /               auto    defaults        1      1
proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0      0
sysfs           /sys            sysfs   defaults        0      0
devpts          /dev/pts        devpts  gid=4,mode=620  0      0
tmpfs           /dev/shm        tmpfs   defaults        0      0
EOF
>>@<<

\subsection{Default .profile}

The default \verb/.profile/ is used when creating a new user.  We set up the
default path for both normal users and \verb/root/.  We also set up environment
variables expected by various POSIX commands.

<<basics-profile>>=
#the default .profile
cat > ${OSDIR}/etc/profile << "EOF"
export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin

if [ `id -u` -eq 0 ] ; then
        PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
        unset HISTFILE
fi


# Set up some environment variables.
export USER=`id -un`
export LOGNAME=$USER
export HOSTNAME=`/bin/hostname`
export HISTSIZE=1000
export HISTFILESIZE=1000
export PAGER='/bin/more '
export EDITOR='/bin/vi'
EOF
>>@<<

\subsection{Hostname}

For this image, we are using the hostname \verb/vbuilder/, or Velo Builder.

<<basics-hostname>>=
#the hostname
echo "vbuilder" > ${OSDIR}/etc/HOSTNAME
>>@<<

\subsection{Login Message}

Here, we use a very simple login message, that just echoes the name of the build
system.  If we were building a production image, then we'd consider something
more meaningful.

<<basics-login>>=
#Login message.
cat > ${OSDIR}/etc/issue<< "EOF"
vbuilder
EOF
>>@<<

\subsection{busybox inittab}

We are using \verb/busybox/ to provide most commands and a simple init process.
When \verb/busybox/ runs as init, it looks at \verb"/etc/inittab" to decide
which processes to spawn at startup.  It also provides special scripting hooks
for system init, system shutdown, and system reboot. We define script locations
for each.

<<basics-busybox-inittab>>=
#basic busybox init
cat > ${OSDIR}/etc/inittab<< "EOF"
::sysinit:/etc/rc.d/startup

tty1::respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1
tty2::respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty2
tty3::respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty3
tty4::respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty4
tty5::respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty5
tty6::respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty6

::shutdown:/etc/rc.d/shutdown
::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot
EOF
>>@<<

\subsection {mdev configuration}

The mdev system controls how devices are populated by the kernel both during
initial boot and also as they are discovered during hot plugging.  This config
defines how these devices should be configured, what permissions and ownership
they should have, and any commands that should be executed when they are
detected.

<<basics-mdev-conf>>=
#default mdev
xvar='$x'
MDEV_VAR='$MDEV'
CONSOLE_MKDIR_CD="@mkdir -pm 755 fd && cd fd"
CONSOLE_FORLOOP="for x in 0 1 2 3; do ln -sf /proc/self/fd/${xvar} ${xvar}; done"
CONSOLE_MDEV_CMD="$CONSOLE_MKDIR_CD && $CONSOLE_FORLOOP"
cat > ${OSDIR}/etc/mdev.conf<<EOF
# Devices:

>>@<<

\subsection{Grub Configuration}

We boot the image with the GRUB bootloader. The following configuration file
sets up a single menu entry in the boot loader which boots our kernel with a
serial console.  We will use the serial console for further configuration.

<<basics-grub-cfg>>=
#Build the grub configuration
BOOT_CONSOLE="console=/dev/ttyS0,115200"
BOOT_OPTIONS="root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet $BOOT_CONSOLE"
cat > ${OSDIR}/boot/grub/grub.cfg<<EOF

set default=0
set timeout=5

set root=(hd0,1)

menuentry "vbuilder" {
        linux   /boot/vmlinuz-${LINUX_VERSION} ${BOOT_OPTIONS}
}
EOF
>>@<<

\subsection{Initial Log Files}

For the system to boot up correctly, we need to set up some dummy log files.
These will be appended during bootup and by busybox.

<<basics-log-files>>=
#set the log files
touch ${OSDIR}/var/run/utmp ${OSDIR}/var/log/{btmp,lastlog,wtmp}
chmod -v 664 ${OSDIR}/var/run/utmp ${OSDIR}/var/log/lastlog
>>@<<

\section{Downloading and Extracting Source Packages}

Before the build, we will download and extract all packages.  We need to build
GCC, the Linux kernel, GRUB, and busybox.  So, we will start with downloading,
verifying, and extracting all of them.

<<FILE:build.sh>>=
    <<download-verify-and-extract-gcc>>
    <<download-verify-and-extract-gmp>>
    <<download-verify-and-extract-mpfr>>
    <<download-verify-and-extract-mpc>>
    <<download-verify-and-extract-linux>>
    <<download-verify-and-extract-busybox>>
>>@<<

\newpage

\subsection{The GCC Source Package}

For gcc, we will check to see if the package file has been downloaded. If it has
not, we will download it.  Then, we will verify its checksum and extract it.

<<download-verify-and-extract-gcc>>=
GCC_BASEFILE=gcc-${GCC_VERSION}.tar.xz
GCC_PKGFILE=${PKG_DIR}/${GCC_BASEFILE}
GCC_URL=http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-${GCC_VERSION}
GCC_DIR=${PKG_DIR}/gcc-${GCC_VERSION}
if [ ! -f ${PKG_DIR}/${GCC_BASEFILE} ]; then
    (cd ${PKG_DIR} && curl -L -O ${GCC_URL}/${GCC_BASEFILE})
else
    echo ${PKG_DIR}/${GCC_BASEFILE} already downloaded.
fi
>>@<<

We can then verify that the GCC package we have matches the pre-computed SHA-512
hash in the script.  This ensures that the package is a known good package that
did not fail in download and was not tampered with.

<<download-verify-and-extract-gcc>>=
GCC_EXPECTED_CKSUM=\
d53a0a966230895c54f01aea38696f81\

153c684ded3f0fa97c82758d9de5c7cf
if [ ! -f ${GCC_PKGFILE}.verified ]; then
    GCC_CKSUM=`openssl dgst -sha512 -hex ${GCC_PKGFILE}`
    GCC_CKSUM=`echo ${GCC_CKSUM} | awk -F= '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/^[ \t]//'`
    if [ "${GCC_EXPECTED_CKSUM}" = "${GCC_CKSUM}" ]; then
        touch ${GCC_PKGFILE}.verified
        echo "${GCC_PKGFILE} verified."
    else
        echo "${GCC_PKGFILE} could not be verified (${GCC_CKSUM})."
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "${GCC_PKGFILE} already verified."
fi
>>@<<

Finally, we can extract gcc.

<<download-verify-and-extract-gcc>>=
if [ ! -f ${GCC_PKGFILE}.extracted ]; then
    (cd ${PKG_DIR} && xz -dc ${GCC_BASEFILE} | tar -xvf -)
    touch ${GCC_PKGFILE}.extracted
else
    echo "${GCC_PKGFILE} already extracted."
fi
>>@<<

\newpage

\subsection{The GMP Source Package}

GMP is the GNU Multiprecision Library.  It is used in GCC as part of its bignum
implementation.  As before, we will repeat the basic download, verify, and
extract process for busybox.  First, we will check to see if the package has
already been downloaded.  If not, we will download it.  Then, we will verify and
extract it.  Finally, we will move this source directory to the GCC source
directory so it is automatically picked up by GCC's configure process.

<<download-verify-and-extract-gmp>>=
GMP_BASEFILE=gmp-${GMP_VERSION}.tar.bz2
GMP_PKGFILE=${PKG_DIR}/${GMP_BASEFILE}
GMP_URL=http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/gmp/${GMP_BASEFILE}
GMP_DIR=${PKG_DIR}/gmp-${GMP_VERSION}
if [ ! -f ${GMP_PKGFILE} ]; then
    (cd ${PKG_DIR} && curl -L -O ${GMP_URL})
else
    echo ${GMP_PKGFILE} already downloaded
fi
>>@<<

We can then verify that the GMP package we have matches the pre-computed
SHA-512 hash in the script.  This ensures that the package is a known good
package that did not fail in download and was not tampered with.

if [ ! -f ${GMP_PKGFILE}.verified ]; then
    GMP_CK=`openssl dgst -sha512 -hex ${GMP_PKGFILE}`
    GMP_CK=`echo ${GMP_CK} | awk -F= '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/^[ \t]//'`
    if [ "${GMP_EXPECTED_HASH}" = "${GMP_CK}" ]; then
        touch ${GMP_PKGFILE}.verified
        echo "${GMP_PKGFILE} verified."
    else
        echo "${GMP_PKGFILE} could not be verified (${GMP_CK})."
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "${GMP_PKGFILE} already verified."
fi
>>@<<

Next, we can extract GMP, and move it to a known good location in the GCC source
tree.

<<download-verify-and-extract-gmp>>=
if [ ! -f ${GMP_PKGFILE}.extracted ]; then
    (cd ${PKG_DIR} && bzip2 -dc ${GMP_BASEFILE} | tar -xvf -)

    touch ${GMP_PKGFILE}.extracted
else
    echo "${GMP_PKGFILE} already extracted."

\subsection{The MPC Source Package}

MPC is a complex floating point library for GCC.  As before, we will repeat the
basic download, verify, and extract process for busybox.  First, we will check
to see if the package has already been downloaded.  If not, we will download it.
Then, we will verify and extract it.  Finally, we will move this source
directory to the GCC source directory so it is automatically picked up by GCC's
configure process.

<<download-verify-and-extract-mpc>>=
MPC_BASEFILE=mpc-${MPC_VERSION}.tar.gz
MPC_PKGFILE=${PKG_DIR}/${MPC_BASEFILE}
MPC_URL=http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/mpc/${MPC_BASEFILE}
MPC_DIR=${PKG_DIR}/mpc-${MPC_VERSION}
if [ ! -f ${MPC_PKGFILE} ]; then
    (cd ${PKG_DIR} && curl -L -O ${MPC_URL})
else
    echo ${MPC_PKGFILE} already downloaded
fi
>>@<<

We can then verify that the MPC package we have matches the pre-computed
SHA-512 hash in the script.  This ensures that the package is a known good

        echo "${MPC_PKGFILE} verified."
    else
        echo "${MPC_PKGFILE} could not be verified (${MPC_CK})."
        exit 1
    fi
else

\newpage

\subsection{The MPFR Source Package}

MPFR is a multi-precision floating point library with rounding, needed by GCC.
As before, we will repeat the basic download, verify, and extract process for
busybox.  First, we will check to see if the package has already been
downloaded.  If not, we will download it.  Then, we will verify and extract it.
Finally, we will move this source directory to the GCC source directory so it is
automatically picked up by GCC's configure process.

<<download-verify-and-extract-mpfr>>=
MPFR_BASEFILE=mpfr-${MPFR_VERSION}.tar.xz
MPFR_PKGFILE=${PKG_DIR}/${MPFR_BASEFILE}
MPFR_URL=http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gnu/mpfr/${MPFR_BASEFILE}
MPFR_DIR=${PKG_DIR}/mpfr-${MPFR_VERSION}
if [ ! -f ${MPFR_PKGFILE} ]; then
    (cd ${PKG_DIR} && curl -L -O ${MPFR_URL})
else
    echo ${MPFR_PKGFILE} already downloaded
fi
>>@<<

We can then verify that the MPFR package we have matches the pre-computed
SHA-512 hash in the script.  This ensures that the package is a known good
package that did not fail in download and was not tampered with.

<<download-verify-and-extract-mpfr>>=
MPFR_EXPECTED_HASH=\
1bd1c349741a6529dfa53af4f0da8d49\
254b164ece8a46928cdb13a994602856\

b3d7d65c201c8f387e421c7f7bee6273
if [ ! -f ${MPFR_PKGFILE}.verified ]; then
    MPFR_CK=`openssl dgst -sha512 -hex ${MPFR_PKGFILE}`
    MPFR_CK=`echo ${MPFR_CK} | awk -F= '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/^[ \t]//'`
    if [ "${MPFR_EXPECTED_HASH}" = "${MPFR_CK}" ]; then
        touch ${MPFR_PKGFILE}.verified
        echo "${MPFR_PKGFILE} verified."
    else
        echo "${MPFR_PKGFILE} could not be verified (${MPFR_CK})."
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "${MPFR_PKGFILE} already verified."
fi
>>@<<

Next, we can extract MPFR, and move it to a known good location in the GCC
source tree.

<<download-verify-and-extract-mpfr>>=
if [ ! -f ${MPFR_PKGFILE}.extracted ]; then
    (cd ${PKG_DIR} && xz -dc ${MPFR_BASEFILE} | tar -xvf -)
    mv ${MPFR_DIR} ${GCC_DIR}/gcc/mpfr
    touch ${MPFR_PKGFILE}.extracted
else
    echo "${MPFR_PKGFILE} already extracted."

\subsection{The Linux Source Package}

We can repeat this basic download, verify, and extract for the Linux kernel.
First, we will check to see if the package has been downloaded.  If not, we will
download it.  Then, we will verify its checksum and extract it.

<<download-verify-and-extract-linux>>=
LINUX_BASEFILE=linux-${LINUX_VERSION}.tar.xz
LINUX_PKGFILE=${PKG_DIR}/${LINUX_BASEFILE}
LINUX_URL=https://mirrors.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/${LINUX_BASEFILE}
LINUX_DIR=${PKG_DIR}/linux-${LINUX_VERSION}
if [ ! -f ${LINUX_PKGFILE} ]; then
  (cd ${PKG_DIR} && curl -L -O ${LINUX_URL})
else
    echo ${LINUX_PKGFILE} already downloaded.
fi
>>@<<

We can then verify that the Linux package we have matches the pre-computed
SHA-512 hash in the script.  This ensures that the package is a known good
package that did not fail in download and was not tampered with.

if [ ! -f ${LINUX_PKGFILE}.verified ]; then
    LINUX_CK=`openssl dgst -sha512 -hex ${LINUX_PKGFILE}`
    LINUX_CK=`echo ${LINUX_CK} | awk -F= '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/^[ \t]//'`
    if [ "${LINUX_EXPECTED_HASH}" = "${LINUX_CK}" ]; then
        touch ${LINUX_PKGFILE}.verified
        echo "${LINUX_PKGFILE} verified."
    else
        echo "${LINUX_PKGFILE} could not be verified (${LINUX_CK})."
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "${LINUX_PKGFILE} already verified."
fi
>>@<<

Finally, we can extract the linux kernel.

<<download-verify-and-extract-linux>>=
if [ ! -f ${LINUX_PKGFILE}.extracted ]; then
    (cd ${PKG_DIR} && xz -dc ${LINUX_BASEFILE} | tar -xvf -)
    touch ${LINUX_PKGFILE}.extracted
else
    echo ${LINUX_PKGFILE} already extracted.

\subsection{The busybox Source Package}

busybox provides us with a Swiss army knife of userland tools, which is perfect
for building a small distribution. As before, we will repeat the basic download,
verify, and extract process for busybox.  First, we will check to see if the
package has already been downloaded.  If not, we will download it.  Then, we
will verify and extract it.

<<download-verify-and-extract-busybox>>=
BUSY_BASEFILE=busybox-${BUSYBOX_VERSION}.tar.bz2
BUSY_PKGFILE=${PKG_DIR}/${BUSY_BASEFILE}
BUSY_URL=https://busybox.net/downloads/${BUSY_BASEFILE}
BUSY_DIR=${PKG_DIR}/busybox-${BUSYBOX_VERSION}
if [ ! -f ${BUSY_PKGFILE} ]; then
    (cd ${PKG_DIR} && curl -L -O ${BUSY_URL})
else
    echo ${BUSY_PKGFILE} already downloaded
fi
>>@<<

We can then verify that the busybox package we have matches the pre-computed
SHA-512 hash in the script.  This ensures that the package is a known good
package that did not fail in download and was not tampered with.

<<download-verify-and-extract-busybox>>=

if [ ! -f ${BUSY_PKGFILE}.verified ]; then
    BUSY_CK=`openssl dgst -sha512 -hex ${BUSY_PKGFILE}`
    BUSY_CK=`echo ${BUSY_CK} | awk -F= '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/^[ \t]//'`
    if [ "${BUSY_EXPECTED_HASH}" = "${BUSY_CK}" ]; then
        touch ${BUSY_PKGFILE}.verified
        echo "${BUSY_PKGFILE} verified."
    else
        echo "${BUSY_PKGFILE} could not be verified (${BUSY_CK})."
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "${BUSY_PKGFILE} already verified."
fi
>>@<<

Finally, we can extract busybox.

<<download-verify-and-extract-busybox>>=
if [ ! -f ${BUSY_PKGFILE}.extracted ]; then
    (cd ${PKG_DIR} && bzip2 -dc ${BUSY_BASEFILE} | tar -xvf -)
    touch ${BUSY_PKGFILE}.extracted
else
    echo "${BUSY_PKGFILE} already extracted."
